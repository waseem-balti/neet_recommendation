# NEET Personalized Recommendation System

 Overview
This project provides personalized recommendations based on student quiz performance for NEET exam preparation. It analyzes quiz data, identifies weak areas, predicts estimated NEET rank, and displays performance visualizations on an interactive dashboard.

 Features
✅ Weak Topic Analysis – Identifies subjects where students struggle the most.  
✅ Personalized Recommendations – Provides targeted study advice based on mistakes.  
✅ NEET Rank Prediction – Uses a probabilistic model to estimate rank.  
✅ Performance Visualization Dashboard – Interactive HTML-based dashboard to track progress.

 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository:

 git clone https://github.com/waseem-balti/neet_recommendation.git
 cd neet-recommendation


2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

 python3 -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
 venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows


3️⃣ Install dependencies:

 pip install -r requirements.txt


4️⃣ Run the Flask API:

 python app.py




 API Endpoints
📌 Analyze Performance:  

GET /analyze?user_id=<id>

_Returns performance insights and study recommendations._

📌 Predict NEET Rank:  

GET /predict-rank?user_id=<id>

_Estimates NEET rank based on quiz performance._

📌 View Interactive Dashboard:  

GET /dashboard?user_id=<id>

_Displays student performance trends with graphs._

 Approach
1️⃣ Data Loading – Fetches user’s quiz history and current quiz attempts.  
2️⃣ Performance Analysis – Calculates accuracy, identifies weak topics, and tracks improvements.  
3️⃣ Recommendations – Generates personalized study plans based on mistakes.  
4️⃣ Rank Prediction – Uses a probabilistic model to estimate NEET rank.  
5️⃣ Visualization – Displays trends via dynamic charts on the HTML dashboard.  


 📊 Sample Visualizations

   1️⃣ Included in the screenshots folder

 Requirements
📌 Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

Flask
pandas
numpy
matplotlib


 Future Improvements
🚀 Enhance rank prediction model with ML
🚀 Add interactive charts using JavaScript (Plotly/D3.js)
🚀 Expand recommendations using AI-based learning patterns
